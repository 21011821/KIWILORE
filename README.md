# KIWILORE
A chaotic multiplayer platformer where flightless kiwis race, battle, and cooperate through lush New Zealand landscapes, uncovering ancient kiwi secrets along the way.

# Core Mechanics:
## Movement: Running, short ground-based hops/jumps (kiwis are flightless!), climbing low obstacles.
## Interaction: Pecking (basic attack, interact with objects), Burrowing (briefly dig underground to dodge or hide), Ground Slam (small area effect after a hop).
## Abilities: Potential for special items or temporary power-ups found in levels (e.g., speed boost berries, temporary invincibility via a Pounamu charm, projectile grub spit).
# Multiplayer Modes:
## Kiwi Race (Competitive): 4+ players race through obstacle courses inspired by NZ environments. First to the finish line wins. Hazards, traps, and shortcuts encourage interaction and chaos.
## Feather Frenzy (Competitive): Arena-based battles where players try to knock each other off platforms or be the last kiwi standing. Peck attacks and power-ups are key.
# Player Progression:
## Unlock cosmetic items (different feather patterns, hats like mini gumboots or buzzy bee antennae, different beak colours).
## Potentially unlock different "types" of kiwis with very minor stat variations (e.g., slightly faster, slightly tougher) to encourage replayability without creating major imbalances.
# Setting & Theme
## Environment: Stylized, vibrant, and slightly fantastical versions of iconic New Zealand landscapes: dense Kauri forests, glowing Waitomo-style caves, geothermal areas, rugged coastlines, snowy Southern Alps foothills.
## Lore: Lighthearted integration of "Kiwi Lore" - perhaps levels involve finding fragments of ancient kiwi tales, interacting with whimsical interpretations of MƒÅori mythology, or discovering hidden areas built by legendary kiwis of the past.
## Art Style: Charming, cartoonish, and expressive. Focus on making the kiwis endearing and the environments visually appealing.
