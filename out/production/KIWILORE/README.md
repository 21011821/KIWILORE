# KIWILORE
A Soothing platformer where flightless kiwis Explore, and discover ancient Kiwi Lore throughout lush New Zealand landscapes.

# Core Mechanics:
## Movement:
Running, short ground-based hops/jumps (kiwis are flightless!), climbing low obstacles.
## Interaction: 
Pecking (basic attack, interact with objects), Burrowing (briefly dig underground to dodge or hide), Ground Slam (small area effect after a hop).
## Abilities: 
Potential for special items or temporary power-ups found in levels (e.g., speed boost berries, temporary invincibility via a Pounamu charm, projectile grub spit).
# Multiplayer Modes:
## Feather Frenzy (Competitive): 
Arena-based battles where players try to knock each other off platforms or be the last kiwi standing. Peck attacks and power-ups are key.
# Player Progression:
Unlock cosmetic items (different feather patterns, hats like mini gumboots or buzzy bee antennae, different beak colours). \n
Potentially unlock different "types" of kiwis with very minor stat variations (e.g., slightly faster, slightly tougher) to encourage replayability without creating major imbalances. MicroTransactions!
# Setting & Theme
## Environment: 
Stylized, vibrant, and slightly fantastical versions of iconic New Zealand landscapes: dense Kauri forests, glowing Waitomo-style caves, geothermal areas, rugged coastlines, snowy Southern Alps foothills.
## Lore: 
Lighthearted integration of "Kiwi Lore" - perhaps levels involve finding fragments of ancient kiwi tales, interacting with whimsical interpretations of MƒÅori mythology, or discovering hidden areas built by legendary kiwis of the past.
## Art Style: 
Charming, cartoonish, terraria esk, and expressive. Focus on making the kiwis endearing and the environments visually appealing.
